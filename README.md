# DAG4MIA
Domain Adaptation and Generalization for Medical Image Analysis

## Code
This repository will offer some projects of our conducted works.  

2022.11.23 Our proposed GAN-free disentanglement network based DG method (CDDSA) is accessible at [Arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.12081).

2022.9.28 Our propsoed Contrastive Semi-supervised Learning based DA method (CS-CADA) was accepted by IEEE TMI. The early access version now is available at [TMI](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9903480)  

2022.9.15 We released the project of our proposed semi-supervised based DA method [CS-CADA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.08605).
