# Datasets/Challenges for Domain Adaptation
1, [CrossMoDa](https://crossmoda.grand-challenge.org/), held at MICCAI 2021
* This challenge proposes the first medical imaging benchmark of unsupervised cross-modality Domain Adaptation approaches (from contrast-enhanced T1 to high-resolution T2).

# Datasets/Challenges for Domain Generalization
1, The [M&Ms Challenge](https://www.ub.edu/mnms/)
* Reference: V. Campello et al., Multi-Centre, Multi-Vendor and Multi-Disease Cardiac Segmentation: The M&Ms Challenge, IEEE TMI 2021.

2, [PolypGen](https://endocv2021.grand-challenge.org), held at ISBI 2021.
* This challenge aims to addressing generalisability in polyp detection and segmentation. The data were from 6 different centres worldwide with 5 datasets types that include: i) multi-centre train-test split from 5 centres ii) polyp size-based split (participants should do this by themselves if of interest), iii) data centre wise split, iv) modality split (only test) and v) one hidden centre test.
* Reference: S. Ali et al., PolypGen: A multi-center polyp detection and segmentation dataset for generalisability assessment, arXiv, 2021.

3, [MIDOG](https://miccai2021.org/en/) microscopy domain generalization challenge, held at MICCAI 2021.
* The task is to detect mitotic figures (cells undergoing cell division) from histopathology images (object detection).
* Images were scanned by 4 different scanners, 3 out of which are labeled. In total the set consists of 200 cases of breast cancer. 

4, [Prostate](https://liuquande.github.io/SAML/), collected by Liu et al.
* A well-organized multi-site dataset for prostate MRI segmentation, which contains prostate T2-weighted MRI data (with segmentation mask) collected from six different data sources out of three public datasets.

5, [Fundus](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1p33nsWQaiZMAgsruDoJLyatoq5XAH-TH/view), collected by Wang et al.
